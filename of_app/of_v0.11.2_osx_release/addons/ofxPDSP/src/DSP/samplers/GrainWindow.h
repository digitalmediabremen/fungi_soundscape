    @brief Single trigger envelope with a DSP-window shape, with included amp.

    This is a combination of an amp and a single trigger envelope that use a window shape. It is useful together with Sampler to create granular sampling modules. It uses linear interpolation on the table, for higher resolution choose a bigger table size. Standard table size is 1024.
