@brief Takes messages from a MessageBuffer and convert them in a trigger output

Generate trigger values from a MessageBuffer. It also has a switch to implement "Single Trigger Mode". In single trigger mode just the first positive message will generate a standard trigger message, the other will generate some "legato" trigger signals that often will not retrigger the envelope from starts; a normal trigger will be emitted only after a message with 0.0f value is received. SequencerGateOutput has no inputs, but you can use the >> operator to connect a MessageBuffer to it.
