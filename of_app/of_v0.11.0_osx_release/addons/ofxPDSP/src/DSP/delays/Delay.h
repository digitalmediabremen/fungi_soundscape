    @brief Digital Delay with a low pass filter in the feedback path.
    
    Delay is a delay with a one pole low pass filter inside the feedback path, controllable with the in_damping() input. The feedback is controllable with the in_feedback(). Both the values from in_feedback() and in_damping() are used just once per buffer, so it has really no sense to patch Units running at audio rate to them. in_time() instead supports audio-rate modulation.  The max time of Delay is settable with setMaxTime() or using the Delay( float timeMS ) constructor.
