@brief Takes messages from a MessageBuffer and convert them in an optionally smoothed value output

Generate smoothed values buffers from a MessageBuffer. You can set the slew time and also control it by patching a MessageBuffer to in_slew_control(). Patch this sequencer to pitch and other control inputs, while using GateSequencer to trigger envelopes. SequencerValueOutput has no inputs, but you can use the >> operator to connect a MessageBuffer to it.
