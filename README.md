# Perceiving_Fungi / Unfolding_Mushrooms

* The general idea is to create an algorithm that receives recent mushroom observations and turns it into music by analyzing mushroom patterns using simple computer vision.

* Try to derive an algoritmin from the mushroom growth pattern.

### TODO
* pull images from mushroom database - ok
* use openCv to proces mushroom image - ok
* create a bit matrix to play with a low sampled image - ok
* do the image fetching and processing in another thread - 
* keep adding new mushrooms as the previous image is consumed by the algo - 
* derive algos - 
* use more instruments - 
* derive algos - 
* play with modules -
