# Perceiving_Fungi / Unfolding_Mushrooms

* The general idea is to create an algorithm that receives recent mushroom observations and turns it into music by analyzing mushroom patterns using simple computer vision.

* Try to derive an algoritmin from the mushroom shape or growth pattern. Image to sound

### TODO
* pull images from mushroom database - ok
* use openCv to proces mushroom image - ok
* create a bit matrix to play with a low sampled image - ok
* do the image fetching and processing in another thread - ok
* keep adding new mushrooms as the previous image is consumed by the algo - ok
* use more instruments - ok
* create Mushroom.h Class and display more information about the schroom in the screen (location, full name) - ok
* use some kind of beat/kick instrument - (playing with attack/decay/sustain makes it more ritmic) - ok
* play with modules, what parameter use to control modules - ok
* how can I make the piece evolve in a more 'musical' way? - ok

### Potential for improving
* how to skip an image when it's not well defined/processed? Example: when hands are present, rulers, etc
* make use of Machine Learning to get mushroom shapes instead of opencv/computer vision
* Missing beats, a lot of mushrooms sounds a bit the same. Tweak parameters, add instruments.
