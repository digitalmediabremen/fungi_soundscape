# Unfolding Mushrooms

* The general idea is to create an algorithm that receives recent mushroom observations and turns it into music by analyzing mushroom patterns using simple computer vision.

* Try to derive an algoritmin from the mushroom growth pattern.


### TODO
* Pull images from mushroom database - ok
* Use openCv to proces mushroom image - ok
* create a bit matrix to play with the a low sampled image - ok
* derive algos - ?
