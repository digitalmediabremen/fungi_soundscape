# Perceiving_Fungi / Unfolding_Mushrooms

* The general idea is to create an algorithm that receives recent mushroom observations and turns it into music by analyzing mushroom patterns using simple computer vision.

* Try to derive an algoritmin from the mushroom growth pattern.

### TODO
* pull images from mushroom database - ok
* use openCv to proces mushroom image - ok
* create a bit matrix to play with a low sampled image - ok
* do the image fetching and processing in another thread - ok
* keep adding new mushrooms as the previous image is consumed by the algo - ok
* use more instruments - ok
* create Mushroom.h Class and display more information about the schroom in the screen (location, full name) - ok
* use some kind of beat/kick instrument -
* play with modules, what parameter use to control modules? - USE PARAMETERS FROM MUSHROOM (Location, Confidence level of species, even description);
* how can I make the piece evolve in a more 'musical' way?
